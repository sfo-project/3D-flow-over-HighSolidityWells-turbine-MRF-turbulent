# Freeze

This extension allows to make cells read-only or frozen. If a cell is read-only, it can be executed, but its input cannot be changed. Frozen cells cannot be either altered or executed.

To change cells' state, select them and press corresponding button.

Cell's state is stored in its metadata and is applied to the cell if the extension is loaded.
