A server extension for [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)
which provides configuration interfaces for notebook extensions (nbextensions).

The `jupyter_nbextensions_configurator` jupyter server extension provides
graphical user interfaces for configuring which nbextensions are enabled
(load automatically for every notebook), and display their readme files.
In addition, for extensions which include an appropriate yaml descriptor file
(see below), the interface also provides controls to configure the extensions'
options.

This project was spun out of work from
[`ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions`][contrib repo url].

Usage
-----

Once `jupyter_nbextensions_configurator` is installed and enabled, and your
notebook server has been restarted, you should be able to find the nbextensions
configuration interface at the url `<base_url>nbextensions`, where
`<base_url>` is described below (for simple installs, it's usually just `/`, so
the UI is at `/nbextensions`).

### base_url

For most single-user notebook servers, the dashboard (the file-browser view)
is at

    http://localhost:8888/tree

So the `base_url` is the part between the host (`http://localhost:8888`) and
`tree`, so in this case it's the default value of just `/`.
If you have a non-default base url (such as with JupyterHub), you'll need to
prepend it to the url. So, if your dashboard is at

    http://localhost:8888/custom/base/url/tree

then you'll find the configurator UI page at

    http://localhost:8888/custom/base/url/nbextensions


### tree tab

In addition to the main standalone page, the nbextensions configurator
interface is also available as a tab on the dashboard, once it's been
configured to appear there.
To do this, go to the `/nbextensions` url described above, and enable the
nbextension `Nbextensions dashboard tab`.

YAML file format
----------------

You don't need to know about the yaml files in order simply to use
`jupyter_nbextensions_configurator`.
A notebook extension is 'found' by the `jupyter_nbextensions_configurator`
server extension when a special yaml file describing the nbextension and its
options is found in the notebook server's `nbextensions_path`.
The yaml file can have any name with the extension `.yaml` or `.yml`, and
describes the notebook extension and its options to
`jupyter_nbextensions_configurator`.

The case-sensitive keys in the yaml file are as follows:

 * `Type`,            (**required**) a case-sensitive identifier, must be `IPython Notebook Extension` or `Jupyter Notebook Extension`
 * `Main`,            (**required**) the main javascript file that is loaded, typically `main.js`
 * `Name`,            the name of the extension
 * `Description`,     a short explanation of the extension
 * `Link`,            a URL for more documentation. If this is a relative url with a `.md` extension (recommended!), the markdown readme is rendered in the configurator UI.
 * `Icon`,            a URL for a small icon for the configurator UI (rendered 120px high, should preferably end up 400px wide. Recall HDPI displays may benefit from a 2x resolution icon).
 * `Compatibility`,   Jupyter major version compatibility, e.g. `3.x` or `4.x`, `3.x 4.x`, `3.x, 4.x, 5.x`
 * `Parameters`,      an optional list of configuration parameters. Each item is a dictionary with (some of) the following keys
   * `name`,          (**required**) the name used to store the configuration variable in the config json. It follows a json-like structure, so you can use `.` to separate sub-objects e.g. `myextension.buttons_to_add.play`.
   * `description`,   a description of the configuration parameter
   * `default`,       a default value used to populate the tag in the configurator UI, if no value is found in config. Note that this is more of a hint to the user than anything functional - since it's only set in the yaml file, the javascript implementing the extension in question might actually use a different default, depending on the implementation.
   * `input_type`,    controls the type of html tag used to render the parameter in the configurator UI. Valid values include `text`, `textarea`, `checkbox`, [html5 input tags such as `number`, `url`, `color`, ...], plus a final type of `list`
   * `list_element`,  a dictionary with the same `default` and `input_type` keys as a `Parameters` entry, used to render each element of the list for parameters with input_type `list`
   * finally, extras such as `min`, `step` and `max` may be used by `number` tags for validation

Example:

```yaml
Type: Jupyter Notebook Extension
Name: Limit Output
Description: This extension limits the number of characters that can be printed below a codecell
Link: readme.md
Icon: icon.png
Main: main.js
Compatibility: 4.x
Parameters:
- name: limit_output
  description: Number of characters to limit output to
  input_type: number
  default: 10000
  step: 1
  min: 0
- name: limit_output_message
  description: Message to append when output is limited
  input_type: text
  default: '**OUTPUT MUTED**'
```


Troubleshooting
---------------

If you encounter problems with this server extension, you can:
 * check the [issues page][this repo issues] for the [github repository][this repo].
   If you can't find one that fits your problem, please create a new one!
 * ask in the project's [gitter chatroom][gitter url]

For debugging, useful information can (sometimes) be found by:

 * Checking for error messages in the browser's [JavaScript console][javascript console howto].
 * Checking for messages in the notebook server's logs. This is particularly
   useful when the server is run with the `--debug` flag, to get as many logs
   as possible.
